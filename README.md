# angular-web-container

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-15-theme-toggle)

Instructions:

- Build out your themes like how I've done in styles.scss
- In a component, add some sort of toggle or select (depending upon the number of themes you have), that will modify the document element's 'theme' attribute.
- Add class of mat-app-background to body tag if background color change is desired on toggling between themes
